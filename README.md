# 1830005015-FYP-code

This is the final year project for Kevin Haoxin Jiang in UIC.

It is a Hearthstone turn-optimization simulator based on the simulator "fireplace" created by Jerome Leclanche.

Reference: https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace

I have uploaded two zip files.

The first is the whole simulator that contained all the files. The second is the specific code for each part of my FYP. You can just substitute them into the first file according to the document path to see different code work
